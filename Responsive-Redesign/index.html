        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <div>
            <p>
                In this project, I am going to select a public website, analyze its shortcomings, and then build a
                website for improvement, especially the issue of responsiveness. Then the responsive website that I
                build could support screens of all three sizes: PC, tablet, and phone.
            </p>
            <p>
                This work allows me to upgrade and transform the established website, which is more beneficial to
                exercise my skills. I can change the features according to my thoughts as a user. And through this work,
                I can have a clearer understanding of the basic structure and function of the website, and better
                understand the experience and needs of users. </p>

        <h3>Analysis</h3>
        <p>This is a weekly story collection voice channel website. I chose this site because as a first-time user, I
            felt that the design of the navigation bar was not very friendly and did not support the screen response of
            the tablet, which made me feel that it needed to be improved.</p>
        <p>Here is the screenshot of the website, and the link to <a href="https://thedirtpod.com/episodes"
                target="_blank">Click Here</a>.</p>

                    <h3>Usability</h3>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The site has very small navigation bar buttons, which are not user-friendly.</li>
                        <li>The site has too much white space at the top, but the content sections are too close
                            together, and the ratio is not suitable for usability.</li>
                        <li>The site supports web and mobile browsing, but it doesn't support tablet or middle size, and
                            the navigation bar buttons overlap.</li>
                        <li>The site's image ratio is too large, with one image taking up about a quarter of the screen,
                            and the content is too tightly packed for reading.</li>
                        <li>The "Read More" button is not obvious and provides a picture and subtitle as hyperlinks
                            which are too close, the conceptual model did not agree with learnablility.</li>

                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The "Read More" button is too low contrast for users to read.</li>
                        <li>Also, the time and the text for the button are not obvious with the light grey.</li>
                        <li>Redundant link: having three hyperlinks pointing to the same place in a single card is
                            redundant and impractical, causing confusion and confusion to users.</li>
                        <li>Some buttons do not use the aria tag to provide valid information to the user.</li>
                    </ul>

        <h3>Low-fidelity Wireframing</h3>
        <p>Here are my lo-fi frame that shows three different screen frameworks. And it also shows the footer if
            scrolling to the bottom. This prototype could let us know how will it change. Basically, the main part is
            the navigation and different screen layout and each episode would be seperatly more to make the page clean.
            Although the tablet only shows one column, when it uses as horizontal, it will display two columns as well.
        </p>
        <div class="justify-content-center">

    <div class="text" id="vis">
        <h3>Visual Design Style</h3>
        <p>Here is some style I may need to use for my hi-fi. Because the original website is using yellow, white, and
            black which are the main color of the logo. Then I am also going to use it and make yellow the main theme.
            Also, I change the style of the button and use cards to contain the episodes. The color and the hover status
            of buttons would be more obvious and helpful.</p>

        <h3>High-Fidelity Prototyping</h3>
        <p>Here are my hi-fi prototypes, the annotated indicates the size of font and color used, but for the margin and
            padding, since it is changing responsively, I didn't mention lots of this. The overall looking will be
            better and the color is soft and comfortable. By the way, the size of the
            tablet is iPad pro which is larger than regular so that could put two-column.</p>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>Based on the above wireframes and prototypes, I recreated the website page using HTML and CSS. Here is a link
            to the website:</p>
        <div class="d-flex justify-content-center"><a class="btn btn-lg btn-info rounded-5"
                href="redesign/episodes.html" target="_blank">
                <h5>New Website Page Episodes</h5>
            </a></div>
        <div>
            <p>
            <h4>Some features for new website page:</h4>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The website properly scaled for mobile, desktop, and tablet screen sizes.</li>
                <li>It use collapse button for the navigation bar when small screen to make the function clearer.</li>
                <li>The layout using card to make each episode seperatly could be more readable.</li>
                <li>It also change some grey color which is low contrast to yellow or orange to make it more pretty and
                    comfotable.</li>
                <li>The button responsive for hover is changing the color that follow the them of the website.</li>
                <li>The website will fixed the navigation bar when the screen become smaller, good for reading.</li>
                <li>The button for each bar is bigger and more obvious to click rather than using picture or text.</li>
                <li>Since the footer hyperlink is consistent with the design of the original website, virtual buttons
                    (image) are used instead.</li>
            </ul>
